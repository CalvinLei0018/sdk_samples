### How to use “Enlarge video” feature

1.  Click with right button on the video window (please note this menu is only available when there is an active stream).
2.  In the “Select quality” dialog select "High” option.

# BE CAREFUL: in this case video is not resized so if you have 4K set in your room you will have 3840x2160 window. Mind your monitor resolution!

3.  In order to return to default mode (small video):
    *   either click again on the SMALL video window and select "Low" option;
    *   or just close the external (LARGE) window.

*   In addition: when you use enlarged video the window for local video will be called "Local preview", for other participants - "Participant #1", "Participant #2" etc.
