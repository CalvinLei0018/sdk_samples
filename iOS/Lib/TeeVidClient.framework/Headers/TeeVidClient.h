/*!
 @brief TeeVid video conferencing client.
 @discussion This client provides ability to connect to conference rooms hosted on TeeVid servers.
 
 To support various call flows driven by configuration settings of specific conference room, consumer of this client must provide a delegate
 which will be called when specific phases of call setup reached and/or conference state changes.
 
 Typicall call flow would include:
 
 - Instantiate new instance of TeeVidClient (passing a delegate)
 
 - Initiate connection using one of the "connectTo" methods
 
 - React on various callbacks to a delegate
 
 - Disconnect from conference room when call is done.
 
 Depending on application design, client instance can be re-used for multiple calls, or, new instance can be created for each call.
 
 TeeVidClient can be instantiated in two different modes: in first mode video layout is controlled by client, in second mode - by application.
 
 When video layout is controlled by client, video of conference room participants is rendered in a view provided by application. Application is in control of size and position of that view, but, layout of multiple videos in the provided view is controlled by the client itself. Application can choose one of the two video layouts:
 
 - Automatic. In this layout, client will render video from multiple participants and change layout automatically based on number of participants
 
 - Single video. In this layout, client will display video from only one participants, and, application has control on whose video is displayed.
 
 Application can also hide/show local video view and control its position.
 
 In addition to layouts above, client supports so-called "lecture mode". When conference room is in lecture mode, client becomes muted (stops sending both audio and video), and, only lecturer's presentation video stream is diplayed. Application cannot change video layout or unmute client while in lecture mode.
 
 When video layout is controlled by application, application can obtain views where video of each participant is being rendered, and, then, have full control of their position, size and aspect ratio. To instantiate client in such mode, application should use overloaded init method without passing view to render participants video in.

 Below is an example of initializing TeeVidClient in ViewController and initiating connection to a conference room.
 @code
 - (void)viewDidLoad {
     [super viewDidLoad];
     // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib
 
     // Initialize TeeVidClient in a mode when video layout is managed by client
     // Pass whatever view you want video to be rendered in
     CGRect bounds = self.view.frame;
     CGRect frame = CGRectMake(bounds.origin.x, bounds.origin.y + 20, bounds.size.width, bounds.size.height - 64);
     conferenceView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
     [self.view addSubview:conferenceView];
     teeVidClient = [[TeeVidClient alloc] initWithView:conferenceView options:nil andDelegate:self];
 
     // Initiate conference room connection
     [teeVidClient connectTo:_roomId at:_serverAddress as:_participantName withPin:nil];
 }
